  <h1>About HSSDR</h1> 
 
 
 
 <p> HSSDR(Hypergraph System Supporting Design and Reasoning) is designed to support conceptual   phase of architectural design. 
 </p>
 <p>
 HSSDR is a research prototype of a CAD tool. Its internal  representation is graph-based and reasoning mechanisms are driven by first-order logic. </p>
 <p>
 HSSDR was created as part of ph. d. thesis by Szymon Gajek and members of a team at Department of Design and Computer Graphics
 at Faculty of Physics, Astronomy and Applied Computer Science of Jagiellonian University
